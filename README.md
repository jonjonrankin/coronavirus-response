# COVID LENS

## About

While there are <a href='https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/13/21178289/confirmed-coronavirus-cases-us-countries-italy-iran-singapore-hong-kong'>many</a> <a href='https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-cases-since-100th-case?time=56'>excellent</a> <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html'>visualizations</a> out there depicting the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, I thought the internet could use a more customizable, interactive one. This is not intended to be the fasted-updated or most comprehensive dashboard for keeping up with the numbers. The hope for this project is that you are able to derive your own insights from these visualizations of this data, and thereby more holistically grasp the gravity of this global health crisis.

## Contributing to COVID LENS

Right now, this project is powered by me ðŸ‘‹. I welcome the contributions of any social isolators bored out of their minds. For those curious, COVID LENS is bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and utilizes [Formidable Labs' Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) charting library in conjunction with data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, compiled [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).
